* Do not put all apps into a single container
  * Taking advantage of computational resources
  * scaling
* Pods should contain tightly coupled containers, usually a main container and containers that support the main one
* If containers should be in a single container
  * Do they need to be run together or can they run on different hosts?
  * Do they represent a single whole or are they independent components?
  * Must they be scaled together or individually?
* Full YAML of a deployed pod
  * `k get pod <pod-name> -o yaml`
* List all containers name in a pod
  * `kubectl get pods tongwei -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'`
* Labels
  * attach labels when create resource, add/modify it later
  * show resouce labels
    * `kubectl get pod --show-labels`
  * show resource labels with label column
    * `kubectl get pod -L creation_method,env`
  * Add label to a k8s resource
    `kubectl label po kubia-manual creation_method=manual`
  * Update resource label
    * `kubectl label po kubia-manual-v2 env=debug --overwrite`
  * List pods with label selector
    ```
    kubectl get pod -l creation_method=manual
    kubectl get pod -l env
    kubectl get po -l '!env'
    ```
  * Node is able to be labelled, so the pods could be scheduled to a specific node with label selector
    * Need to add a **nodeSelector** in spec to the pod's YAML
