* Each container in a pod has its own isolated filesystem.
* a volume is created when the pod is started and is destroyed when the pod is deleted.
* It’s not enough to define a volume in the pod; you need to define a VolumeMount inside the container’s spec also.
* Different types of Volumes
    * Special types of volumes
        * secret
        * downwardAPI
        * configMap
* Volumes can also be used by a single container for when a container needs to write data to disk temporarily, such as when performing a sort operation on a large dataset.
* `ENTRYPOINT` is used to define the command that image is run.
* Recall about access the service through the clusterIP and NodePort from the external of the node
    * From inside of the cluster, the service could be reached out from the inside of the cluster with internal clusterIP or NodeIP:NodePort
    * From outside of the cluster, the service could only be reached out from the NodeIP:NodePort
