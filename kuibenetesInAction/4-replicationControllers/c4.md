* Liveness probes
    * Kubernetes can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes
    * Three mechanisms:
      * HTTP Get request - response status
      * TCP Socket - try to see if a TCP connection could be established
      * Exec -  check a random command's exit status code
    * Look the previous pod logs
      * `kubectl logs mypod --previous`
    * From the `k describe pod podName` container section:
      * Liveness and events could be checked.
        ```
        Liveness: http-get http://:8080/ delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
        Explanation:
        The timeout is set to only 1 second, so the container must return a response in 1 second or the probe is counted as failed. The container is probed every 10 seconds period=10s) and the container is restarted after the probe fails three consecutive times (#failure=3).
        ```
      * **initialDelaySeconds** could be used to set up first probe time.
* ReplicationController
  * Replication-Controllers, in general, are meant to create and manage multiple copies (replicas) of pods.
  * Compare matched vs desired pod count, then create/delete pods
  * Three parts:
    * **label selector**: what pods are in the RC scope
    * **replica count**: define the desire number of pods that should be running
    * **pod template**: used when create a new pod replicas
  * The RC is reponding to the resulting state.
  * The pod template could be updated at anytime, but if only affects the pods created afterward, it doesn't affect the existing pods.
  * Delete the RC but leave the pods unmanaged
    * `kubectl delete rc <rcname> --cascade=orphan`
  * ReplicationController will be replaced by ReplicaSet
    * Difference: Whereas a ReplicationController’s label selector only allows matching pods that include a certain label, a ReplicaSet’s selector also allows matching pods that lack a certain label or pods that include a certain label key,regardless of its value.
* *apiVersion* value would be API-Group:API-Version, core API group like pod could be omit.
* ReplicaSet compare ReplicationController
  * more powerful selector
* DaemonSet: To run a pod on all cluster nodes, you create a DaemonSet object
  * pods managed by a DaemonSet bypass the Scheduler completely
* Job resource
  * If the job finishes successfully, the pod is considered complete
  * Pods managed by Jobs are rescheduled until they finish successfully
  * job spec **completions** and **parallelism**
  * limite the time allowed for a job pod to complete
    * **activeDeadlineSeconds**
  * Scheduel job to run periodically or once in the future
    * CronJob is able to implement this feature
    * **startingDeadlineSeconds** cron job start time deadline/ job failed
