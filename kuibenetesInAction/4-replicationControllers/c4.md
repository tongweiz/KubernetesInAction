* Liveness probes
    * Kubernetes can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes
    * Three mechanisms:
      * HTTP Get request - response status
      * TCP Socket - try to see if a TCP connection could be established
      * Exec -  check a random command's exit status code
    * Look the previous pod logs
      * `kubectl logs mypod --previous`
    * From the `k describe pod podName` container section:
      * Liveness and events could be checked.
        ```
        Liveness: http-get http://:8080/ delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
        Explanation:
        The timeout is set to only 1 second, so the container must return a response in 1 second or the probe is counted as failed. The container is probed every 10 seconds period=10s) and the container is restarted after the probe fails three consecutive times (#failure=3).
        ```
      * **initialDelaySeconds** could be used to set up first probe time.
