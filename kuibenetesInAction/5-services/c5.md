Services
* Each service has an IP address and port that never change while the service exists
* Access service from inside of existing pods.
  * Get the service cluster IP by `k get svc`
  * `k exec tongwei-689w6 -- curl -s http://10.105.12.197`
  * The double dash (--) in the command signals the end of command options for kubectl. Everything after the double dash is the command that should be executed inside the pod.
  * **sessionAffinity** is able to make the service forward the request to a specific pod
  * `k get pod -o wide` check more information about pods
  * The biggest benefit of applying **ports name** so is that it enables you to change port numbers later without having to change the service spec.
  * When the pods are initialized, the existing service port and host will be added to pods' environment variables
  * DISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH DNS
    * The kube-system namespace also includes a corresponding service with the name *kube-dns*
    * access the kubia service through its FQDN(fully qualified domain name) instead of its IP
