# StatefulSets - deploying replicated stateful applications
## Replicating stateful pods
### Compare StatefulSets with ReplicaSets or replication controllers
* Pod replicas managed by a ReplicaSet or ReplicationController are much like cattle. Since they are stateless applications
* When a stateful pod instance dies the new instance needs to get the same name, network identity, and state as the one it’s replacing
* Each pod created by a StatefulSet is assigned an ordinal index (zero-based
* a StatefulSet requires you to create a corresponding governing headless Service that’s used to provide the actual network identity to each pod.
* Example: if the governing Service belongs to the default namespace and is called foo, and one of the pods is called A-0, you can reach the pod through its fully qualified domain name, which is **a-0.foo.default.svc.cluster.local**
* StatefulSets also never permit scale-down operations if any of the instances are unhealthy
### Providing stable dedicated storage to each stateful instance

* STATEFULSET’S AT-MOST-ONE SEMANTICS
  * StatefulSet must be absolutely certain that a pod is no longer running before it can create a replacement pod
